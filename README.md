# linear_hashing
Implementation of the linear hashing technique. Linear Hashing is a variant of dynamic hashing where we use a family of hash functions to grow the hash table to reduce collisions and maintain O(1) lookup time complexity. This repo contains an implementation of linear hashing in Python and the explanation of the technique is provided in my blog post - https://abhinav-upadhyay.blogspot.com/2020/12/linear-hashing.html
